# PROJECT-STEGNOGRAPHY
This project implements Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography combined with AES encryption to securely hide and retrieve sensitive data within images. The encryption ensures that even if the hidden data is extracted, it remains unreadable without the correct decryption key.
